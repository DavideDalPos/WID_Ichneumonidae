                This relatively small subfamily comprises about 290 species in 30, 
                mainly small, genera (updated from Yu et al., 2012) found in the 
                Holarctic and the Old World tropics, with one genus (Arotes) 
                reaching South America (Castillo et al., 2011).

              <p>
                Acaenitinae females are easily recognised by the large, 
                elongate hypopygium, although this is not so pronounced in
                 Leptacoenites and Procinetus FÃ¶rster. Other useful characters to 
                 help with recognition (including of males) are: the clypeus with a 
                 median or subapical declivity, or if flat then the labrum widely exposed; 
                 the clypeus often with a median tooth; the hind wing with the nervellus 
                 intercepted above the centre; the propodeum rather flat, without distinct dorsal and 
                 posterior slopes; the fore and mid claws sometimes with an accessory tooth; and the long ovipositor, 
                 lacking a notch but with weak teeth on the lower valves.
