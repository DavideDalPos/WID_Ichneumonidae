(1960) separated the Acaenitinae from the Pimplinae s. l. This pattern of relationships has been confirmed by subsequent studies (Wahl, 1986; 1990; Wahl & Gauld, 1998; Quicke et al., 2009), with Acaenitinae always being recovered within the pimpliformes group of subfamilies. The Diacritinae (biology completely unknown) and Acaenitinae are likely to be basal taxa in the clade of koinobiont endoparasitoid pimpliformes (Wahl & Gauld, 1998; Quicke et al., 2009; Klopfstein et al., 2019). Many authors recognise two tribes within Acaenitinae, Acaenitini and Coleocentrini, but Wahl & Gauld (1998) found that the Coleocentrini are defined only by the absence of apomorphies relative to Acaenitini and argued that tribes should not be recognised. Some phylogenetic studies have failed to recover a monophyletic Acaenitinae (Quicke et al., 2009; Bennett et al., 2019; Klopfstein et al., 2019) but Spasojevic et al.

Records from xylophagous Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera have been repeated frequently in the literature but there seem to be no carefully isolated host records to support these assertions. Aubert (1969) lists various cerambycids as hosts for several species of acaenitine but his primary sources provide little information. Wahl (1990) records two separate rearings of the North American Arotes amoenus Cresson from a species of Melandryidae. Some other records are consistent, for example those of Phaenolobus species reared from cerambycid larvae in plant stems, with several records (including European specimens in BMNH) from Phytoecia and Oberea species (e.g. Fiori, 1947; Haeselbarth, 1983; Scaramozzino, 1982; Wahl, 1986). There are, intriguingly, several records of Phaenolobus species being reared from Sesiidae (Lepidoptera), the most credible of which is that of the non-British P. saltans (Gravenhorst) being reared from a sesiid mining Euphorbia stems in Iran (Karimpour et al., 2007), but parasitoids seem to have been reared in all instances from infested roots rather than from isolated hosts and several species of Cerambycidae are known to infest Euphorbia roots. Records of Procinetus decimator (Gravenhorst) being reared from the noctuid moth Gortyna flavago (Denis & Schiffermüller) relate to misidentifications of Lissonota digestor (Thunberg) (Banchinae). Previously published statements suggested variously that acaenitines are ectoparasitoids or endoparasitoids, although Wahl (1986) surmised that they were endoparasitoid, based on the larval head capsule. ",-1),e("p",null," It has been confirmed that one British species, Acaenitus dubitator (Panzer), is a koinobiont endoparasitoid, suggesting a similar mode of development for the whole subfamily (Shaw & Wahl, 1989). This has also been demonstrated for Leptacoenites notabilis (Desvignes) by Schwarz (2002a), who published a brief biological summary stating that oviposition was into early instar larvae of the weevil Otiorhynchus coecus Germar (as O. niger (Fabricius)) in their earthen cells, with the parasitoid developing as a koinobiont endoparasitoid and pupating in the hosts’ earthen cells. Schwarz (2002a) studied L. notabilis in the Austrian Alps; although it was described from a purportedly British specimen, there have been no further British specimens of L. notabilis and the Austrian host species has not been reliably recorded in Britain (Duff, 2012). The life history of A. dubitator in Scotland, including details of the egg and first, second and final larval instars, is described by Shaw & Wahl (1989). Oviposition, in early summer, is into the first and second larval instars of the weevil Cleonis pigra (Scopoli) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) galling in the root of Cirsium arvense in sand dunes. Eggs and larvae were found free in the haemocoel of the hosts. The egg (dissected from the host) is elongate and tapered at one end. There is evidence that host development is retarded, the full grown Acaenitus larva erupting from the host larva during late July or August, when most unparasitized hosts had already pupated. The cocoon is spun within the host’s pupation chamber in the thistle root. The cocoon is similar to those of several other species which are known: cylindrical, rounded at the ends, smooth and paper-like in texture and brownish in colour. Acaenitus dubitator can overwinter in its cocoon in one of two ways. Some individuals remain as mature larvae and do not become adult the following summer, while others overwinter as morphologically distinct prepupae and are committed to pupate early in the next year and become adult. In those individuals which will become adult in the following year, the change to the prepupal condition takes place soon after cocoon formation. The mature larvae which do not become prepupae are committed to at least a one year delay in their development and do not change to prepupae until late in the following (or perhaps a further subsequent) summer. The habit of overwintering more than once as a cocooned stage is very unusual in temperate ichneumonids and in this species appears to be an adaptation to life in a particularly harsh and uncertain sand dune environment.
