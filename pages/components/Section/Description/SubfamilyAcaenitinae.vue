                This relatively small subfamily comprises about 290 species in 30, 
                mainly small, genera (updated from Yu et al., 2012) found in the 
                Holarctic and the Old World tropics, with one genus (Arotes) 
                reaching South America (Castillo et al., 2011).

                 help with recognition (including of males) are: the clypeus with a 
                 median or subapical declivity, or if flat then the labrum widely exposed; 
                 the clypeus often with a median tooth; the hind wing with the nervellus 
                 intercepted above the centre; the propodeum rather flat, without distinct dorsal and 
                 posterior slopes; the fore and mid claws sometimes with an accessory tooth; and the long ovipositor, 
                 lacking a notch but with weak teeth on the lower valves.

              <p>
                Similarities between the larvae of Orthocentrinae (in the modern sense) and 
                Acaenitinae have been recognised since Townes et al. (1960) separated the Acaenitinae 
                from the Pimplinae s. l. This pattern of relationships has been confirmed by subsequent 
                studies (Wahl, 1986; 1990; Wahl & Gauld, 1998; Quicke et al., 2009), with Acaenitinae always 
                being recovered within the pimpliformes group of subfamilies. The Diacritinae (biology completely unknown) 
                and Acaenitinae are likely to be basal taxa in the clade of koinobiont endoparasitoid pimpliformes 
                (Wahl & Gauld, 1998; Quicke et al., 2009; Klopfstein et al., 2019). Many authors recognise two tribes 
                within Acaenitinae, Acaenitini and Coleocentrini, but Wahl & Gauld (1998) found that the Coleocentrini are 
                defined only by the absence of apomorphies relative to Acaenitini and argued that tribes should not be recognised. 
                Some phylogenetic studies have failed to recover a monophyletic Acaenitinae (Quicke et al., 2009; Bennett et al., 
                2019; Klopfstein et al., 2019) but Spasojevic et al. (2021) found Acaenitinae to be monophyletic and 
                included more genera of Acaenitinae (14) than in previous studies. Spasojevic et al. (2021) found that
                 ‘Coleocentrini’ was paraphyletic with respect to ‘Acaenitini’ and also transferred the genus Pseudopimpla 
                 Habermerhl from Pimplinae to Acaenitinae

                The constituent genera are very narrowly defined, resulting in a relatively large number of species-poor 
                genera and a trickle of newly described genera for species that do not fit current generic definitions 
                (e.g. Sheng & Sun, 2010a); several undescribed taxa in BMNH do not fit within any genera as currently defined.

                The few reliable rearing records for Acaenitinae are from Coleoptera. 
                Records from xylophagous Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera have been repeated 
                frequently in the literature but there seem to be no carefully isolated 
                host records to support these assertions. Aubert (1969) lists various cerambycids 
                as hosts for several species of acaenitine but his primary sources provide little information. 
                Wahl (1990) records two separate rearings of the North American Arotes amoenus Cresson from a 
                species of Melandryidae. Some other records are consistent, for example those of Phaenolobus 
                species reared from cerambycid larvae in plant stems, with several records (including European specimens in BMNH) 
                from Phytoecia and Oberea species (e.g. Fiori, 1947; Haeselbarth, 1983; Scaramozzino, 1982; Wahl, 1986). 
                There are, intriguingly, several records of Phaenolobus species being reared from Sesiidae (Lepidoptera), 
                the most credible of which is that of the non-British P. saltans (Gravenhorst) being reared from a sesiid 
                mining Euphorbia stems in Iran (Karimpour et al., 2007), but parasitoids seem to have been reared in all 
                instances from infested roots rather than from isolated hosts and several species of Cerambycidae are known 
                to infest Euphorbia roots. Records of Procinetus decimator (Gravenhorst) being reared from the noctuid moth 
                Gortyna flavago (Denis & Schiffermüller) relate to misidentifications of Lissonota digestor (Thunberg) (Banchinae). 
                Previously published statements suggested variously that acaenitines are ectoparasitoids or endoparasitoids, 
                although Wahl (1986) surmised that they were endoparasitoid, based on the larval head capsule.

                It has been confirmed that one British species, Acaenitus dubitator (Panzer), is a koinobiont endoparasitoid, 
                suggesting a similar mode of development for the whole subfamily (Shaw & Wahl, 1989). This has also been 
                demonstrated for Leptacoenites notabilis (Desvignes) by Schwarz (2002a), who published a brief biological 
                summary stating that oviposition was into early instar larvae of the weevil Otiorhynchus coecus Germar 
                (as O. niger (Fabricius)) in their earthen cells, with the parasitoid developing as a koinobiont endoparasitoid 
                and pupating in the hosts’ earthen cells. Schwarz (2002a) studied L. notabilis in the Austrian Alps; although 
                it was described from a purportedly British specimen, there have been no further British specimens of L. notabilis 
                and the Austrian host species has not been reliably recorded in Britain (Duff, 2012). The life history of 
                A. dubitator in Scotland, including details of the egg and first, second and final larval instars, is described 
                by Shaw & Wahl (1989). Oviposition, in early summer, is into the first and second larval instars of the weevil 
                Cleonis pigra (Scopoli) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) galling in the root of Cirsium arvense in sand dunes. 
                Eggs and larvae were found free in the haemocoel of the hosts. The egg (dissected from the host) is elongate and 
                tapered at one end. There is evidence that host development is retarded, the full grown Acaenitus larva erupting 
                from the host larva during late July or August, when most unparasitized hosts had already pupated. The cocoon is 
                spun within the host’s pupation chamber in the thistle root. The cocoon is similar to those of several other 
                species which are known: cylindrical, rounded at the ends, smooth and paper-like in texture and brownish in colour. 
                Acaenitus dubitator can overwinter in its cocoon in one of two ways. Some individuals remain as mature larvae and 
                do not become adult the following summer, while others overwinter as morphologically distinct prepupae and are 
                committed to pupate early in the next year and become adult. In those individuals which will become adult in the 
                following year, the change to the prepupal condition takes place soon after cocoon formation. The mature larvae 
                which do not become prepupae are committed to at least a one year delay in their development and do not change to 
                prepupae until late in the following (or perhaps a further subsequent) summer. The habit of overwintering more 
                than once as a cocooned stage is very unusual in temperate ichneumonids and in this species appears to be an 
                adaptation to life in a particularly harsh and uncertain sand dune environment.
