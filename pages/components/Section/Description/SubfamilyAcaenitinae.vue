                This relatively small subfamily comprises about 290 species in 30, 
                mainly small, genera (updated from Yu et al., 2012) found in the 
                Holarctic and the Old World tropics, with one genus (Arotes) 
                reaching South America (Castillo et al., 2011).

                Acaenitinae females are easily recognised by the large, 
                elongate hypopygium, although this is not so pronounced in
                 Leptacoenites and Procinetus Förster. Other useful characters to 
                 help with recognition (including of males) are: the clypeus with a 
                 median or subapical declivity, or if flat then the labrum widely exposed; 
                 the clypeus often with a median tooth; the hind wing with the nervellus 
                 intercepted above the centre; the propodeum rather flat, without distinct dorsal and 
                 posterior slopes; the fore and mid claws sometimes with an accessory tooth; and the long ovipositor, 
                 lacking a notch but with weak teeth on the lower valves.

              <p>
                Similarities between the larvae of Orthocentrinae (in the modern sense) and 
                Acaenitinae have been recognised since Townes et al. (1960) separated the Acaenitinae 
                from the Pimplinae s. l. This pattern of relationships has been confirmed by subsequent 
                studies (Wahl, 1986; 1990; Wahl & Gauld, 1998; Quicke et al., 2009), with Acaenitinae always 
                being recovered within the pimpliformes group of subfamilies. The Diacritinae (biology completely unknown) 
                and Acaenitinae are likely to be basal taxa in the clade of koinobiont endoparasitoid pimpliformes 
                (Wahl & Gauld, 1998; Quicke et al., 2009; Klopfstein et al., 2019). Many authors recognise two tribes 
                within Acaenitinae, Acaenitini and Coleocentrini, but Wahl & Gauld (1998) found that the Coleocentrini are 
                defined only by the absence of apomorphies relative to Acaenitini and argued that tribes should not be recognised. 
                Some phylogenetic studies have failed to recover a monophyletic Acaenitinae (Quicke et al., 2009; Bennett et al., 
                2019; Klopfstein et al., 2019) but Spasojevic et al. (2021) found Acaenitinae to be monophyletic and 
                included more genera of Acaenitinae (14) than in previous studies. Spasojevic et al. (2021) found that
                 ‘Coleocentrini’ was paraphyletic with respect to ‘Acaenitini’ and also transferred the genus Pseudopimpla 
                 Habermerhl from Pimplinae to Acaenitinae

                The constituent genera are very narrowly defined, resulting in a relatively large number of species-poor 
                genera and a trickle of newly described genera for species that do not fit current generic definitions 
                (e.g. Sheng & Sun, 2010a); several undescribed taxa in BMNH do not fit within any genera as currently defined.
