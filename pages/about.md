# {{frontmatter.title}}
The World Ichneumonidae Database (WID) is a collaborative effort, aimed to reduced the taxonomic impediment revolvind around the large family Ichneumonidae (Hyemnoptera). Without the efforts of the curators below, this website would have never been built.

## Dig deeper
Please contact us if you need extended access to the data underlying here. The TaxonWorks interfaces used to curate these data include wide range of additional filtering, reporting, and curatorial functionality. With a little training from us we'd be happy to provide you access to this additional functionality. Over time we expect this site to gradually mirror that extended functionality.

## Contact
If you have a question, want to report new data relevant to the project, or have error our preferred means of contact is to file an issue on our [project tracker](https://github.com/our/project/tracker). You can also [chat live with us](https://slackservername). We can also be reached via [email](mailto:{{frontmatter.contact_email}}).

## The Species File Group (SFG)
The WID is made possible by the technical and intellectual help from the [Species File Group (SFG)](https://speciesfilegroup.org/index.html), which is an endowment-funded collective of specialists whose broader goal is the advancement of biodiversity informatics. We are located at the University of Illinois, Illinois Natural History Survey. Our group supports the following software/activities:
- [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks.org) - a workbench for taxonomists and natural history museums.
- [Global Names Architecture](https://globalnames.org/) - finding, parsing, and resolving taxon names from literature. Lead Developer: Dmitry Mozzherin.
- [Catalogue of Life](https://catalogueoflife.org/) - editorial group, and data assembly hub. Executive Editor Yury Roskov and Database Manager Geoff Ower.
- Taxonomic/Systematic Research supporting several insect groups.

## Data
Data for these pages is collaboratively curated online in a [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks) project. All data behind this site served as JSON through calls to a [TaxonWorks API](https://api.taxonworks.org). You can follow along by using the Console of your browser to explore the Network tab. 

## Technical
Want to create your own site? This website is built completely on open-source software. There is a [site template](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/<something>) with more information. Data are curated in a [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks.org) project then shared via a [TaxonWorks API](https://api.taxonworks.org). Come [chat](https://gitter.im/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks) with the TaxonWorks community at any time.
